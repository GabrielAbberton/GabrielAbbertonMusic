<h1>Gabriel Abberton</h1>
<h2>My Music</h2>
<p>A lot of my music is inspired by my favorite composer, Hans Zimmer. I personally think he's one of the best film composers ever to walk the earth. I aim to do what he has been doing for years, mix genres and bring new modern ideas to the ideas of classical and orchestral music. I have always looked up to the way he does this, particularly in the Dune score. I hope to be able to mix different aspects and techniques of various styles of music to make new and unique pieces unlike anything else before. For now, I write piano solos which, over time, I hope to turn into full orchestral pieces. My music is on Spotify at <a href: "https://open.spotify.com/artist/47sGvVOul5ykf2GrbJc25Z">https://open.spotify.com/artist/47sGvVOul5ykf2GrbJc25Z</a>, and on YouTube at <a href: "https://www.youtube.com/@gabrielabberton9089">https://www.youtube.com/@gabrielabberton9089</a>.</p>
